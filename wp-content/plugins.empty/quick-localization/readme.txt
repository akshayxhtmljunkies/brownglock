Quick Localisation allows site admins to patch Wordpress translations of any theme and any plugin without leaving the control panel

== Description ==

Quick Localisation allows to hook on `gettext`, `gettext_with_context`, `ngettext`, and `ngettext_with_context` so that one can easily tweak Wordpress translations generated by functions `__`, `_e`, `_ex`, `_n`, `_nx`, `_x`, `translate`, and `translate_with_gettext_context`.

For installation please see the [corresponding section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/quick-localization/installation/). It is as trivial as copying the plugin folder in your WordPress.

To get the flavour of what the plugin actually does, see the [screen shots](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/quick-localization/screenshots/).

Once installed and activated, the plugin back-end will be accessible via a separate menu in the admin panel (WP Admin -> Quick Localisation).

N.B. by all means this plugin is not a replacement of the standard [Wordpress localisation framework](http://many.at/wordpress-localisation/translating-wordpress/). In fact, webmasters are advised to use it as a long-term solution.

However Quick Localisation comes very handy when quick patches or unconventional translations are required.

The plugin offers the following options.

= Editing Localisation Table =

* Old text
* New text (optional; empty values will remove the localisation subject)
* Text domain (allows to target specific plugin or theme "domains"; if set to `_ALL_` - it will be applied to all matching text)

= Export =

* Allows exporting saved localisation for easy copy-pasting between the sites and backups.
* This feature also comes handy later when generating actual `.PO` files.

= Import =

* It is possible to import previously saved localisations or just copy them from other WordPress sites.
* It is possible to empty the localisation database prior to import as well as to choose whether or not to overwrite already existing entries.

= Hooks =

At the moment Quick Localisation hooks on `gettext`, `gettext_with_context`, `ngettext`, and `ngettext_with_context` filters with very low priority (namely, 1000), allowing it to be the last one to have a say on translations.

Should one use other similar `*gettext*` hooks, the priority can be changed in `index.php`.

== Installation ==

= As easy, as 1-2-3 =

1. Upload `quick-localization` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Specify text to translate
1. Voila!

= Usage =

Activate the plugin. Settings can be accessed via WP Admin -> Quick Localisation.

Use Edit, Export, and Import pages to manipulate translations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How big can the database be? =

The bigger the database, the more parsing the plugin has to perform, the higher the load. The relationship is exponential. Though we tested it with thousand words and the extra load was minimal.

= Some plugins appear not to be translated, what can be done about it? =

Wordpress activates plugins alphabetically or in the order provided by the file system. Having said this, if one of these earlier plugins localises its strings directly on the initialisation, Quick Localisation won't be able to catch those.

A known way around it is as follows:

1. Create `quick-localization.php` in the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory
1. Add the following line into `quick-localization.php`:<br />`<?php include_once ABSPATH . "wp-content/plugins/quick-localization/index.php"; ?>`
1. Voila!
