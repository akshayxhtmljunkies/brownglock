= How To Use =

1. Click the MaxButtons page from the admin menu.
1. Click the Add New button.
1. Fill out and select the options needed to build your button.
1. Once you're ready, click Save.
1. A shortcode will be generated (ex: [maxbutton id="17"] or [maxbutton name="My Button Name"]).
1. Use the shortcode anywhere in your content.

You can also pass the button text and URL as parameters in the shortcode, giving you even greater flexibility. For example, if you want to create a set of buttons that look exactly the same, except for the text and URL, you could do something like this:

[maxbutton id="17" text="Search Google" url="http://google.com"]

[maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name" text="Search Yahoo" url="http://yahoo.com"]

Another parameter you can give the shortcode is window, which tells the button whether or not to open the URL in a new window (by default the button opens the URL in the current window). To do so you always give the window parameter the value "new", shown below. Anything else will open the button URL in the current window.

[maxbutton id="17" window="new"]

You can also use the nofollow parameter, which will add a rel="nofollow" attribute to the button when set to true, as shown below (the default is false):

[maxbutton id="17" nofollow="true"]

NOTE: Passing parameters to the shortcode overrides those settings saved as part of the button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the shortcode in a sidebar/widget? =

Starting with version 1.4.0 widget support is built-in, so all you have to do is add the button shortcode to your widget (ex: [maxbutton id="17"] or [maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name"]). Prior to version 1.4.0 you had to enable widget shortcode support yourself, as described in [this forum post](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-make-shortcodes-work-in-a-widget).

= How can I add the shortcode to my post/page template? =

Simply add this code snippet to any of your theme template files:
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton id="17"]'); ?>`

= Part of my button is cutoff, how do I fix that? =

Try enabling the container and setting its margin options. You could also fix this manually by surrounding your button shortcode with a div element with margins. For example:

`<div style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;">
    <?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton id="17"]'); ?>
    <?php echo do_shortcode('[maxbutton name="MaxButtons Button Name"]'); ?>
</div>`

Then adjust the margin values as needed (the order is: top, right, bottom, left).

= How do I center the button on a page? =

Enable the "Wrap with Center Div" option in the Container settings.

= How do I align multiple buttons next to each other? =

Enable the container option and set the alignment property to either "display: inline-block" or "float: left". You might also want to add some margin values to put some spacing between your buttons. If that doesn't work, try using a simple HTML table:

`<table>
	<tr>
		<td>[maxbutton id="1"]</td>
		<td>[maxbutton id="2"]</td>
		<td>[maxbutton id="3"]</td>
	</tr>
</table>`
