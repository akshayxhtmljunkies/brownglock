Merges/Concatenates CSS & Javascript and then minifies using Minify (for CSS) and Google Closure (for JS with Minify as a fallback).

== Description ==

This plugin merges/concatenates Cascading Style Sheets & Javascript files into groups. It then minifies the generated files using Minify (for CSS) and Google Closure (for JS - fallback to Minify when not available). Minification is done via WP-Cron so that it doesn't slow down the website. When JS or CSS changes files are re-processed. No need to empty cache!

Inspired by [MinQueue](https://wordpress.org/plugins/minqueue/) and [Dependency Minification](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dependency-minification) plugins.

Minification by [Minify](https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify) and [Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/)

In order to ensure fast loading times its recommended to set long expiry dates for CSS and JS as well as make sure gzip or deflate is on.

**Note** Installing this plugin on a server with the eAccellerator module installed has the potential to break as Minify uses anonymous functions which return NULL. [View eAccellerator Issue Thread](https://github.com/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/issues/12)

**Features**

*	Merges JS and CSS files to reduce the number of HTTP requests
*	Handles scripts loaded in the header & footer
*	Compatable with localized scripts
*	Creates WP-Cron for minification as this can take some time to complete
*	Minifies JS with Google Closure (requires php exec) with fallback to Minify
*	Minifies CSS with Minify
*	Failed minification doesn't break the site. Visitors will instead only see the merged results
*	Stores Assets in /wp-content/mmr/ folder
*	Uses last modified date in filename so any changes to JS or CSS automatically get re-processed and downloaded on browser refresh
*	View status of merge and minify on settings page in WordPress admin

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `merge-minify-refresh` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or upload the zip within WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
