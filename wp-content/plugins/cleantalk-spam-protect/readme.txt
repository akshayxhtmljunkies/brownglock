Sometimes CAPTCHA reminds doodle 2x year old child. For users with vision problems captcha is just an insurmountable obstacle. Users hate captcha. Captcha for users means "hate". Unreadable CAPTCHA stops about 80% of site visitors. After 2 failed attempts to bring it up to 95% reject further attempts. 
At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource both from bots and visitors. CAPTCHA is not a panacea from spam. Doubts Concerning the Need for CAPTCHA?

Anti spam module, installed on the website, sends the behaviour parameters of the visitor or spam bot. These parameters are estimated, and service makes a decision – to post a message or to define it as spam and reject. On the basis of such checks, the service forms its own list of email addresses used by spam bots. Likewise the registrations of visitors are checked. The service adds not only email addresses to the blacklist, but also IP addresses and domains of the websites that are promoted through spam mailout. All of this happens automatically and requires no action from the administration of the website. At 2.5 million queries the service makes a mistake in 40-45 cases, i.e. CleanTalk detects spam with 99.9982% accuracy.

1. Checks by Email, IP, domains at spam activities list. The plugin online use spam activity database at cleantalk.org, which are consist more then 1 billion records about spam activity IPs, Email, Domains and ASN. If the senders IP or Email matches with database, the sender gets some spam scores. To reduce false/positive rate the plugin doesn't use only blacklist test to ban spammers. The sender will be banned only if multiple spam test failed.

There are a few reasons for this:

* With the indexing of your web-site by the search systems, appearance of external links and better search results position, your web-site attracts more and more spambots.
* Non-transparent protection systems like CAPTCHA or question/answer, that don't have spam attacks statistics, don't let you see the whole picture, or the picture is incomplete.
* Counting methods for spam attacks and spam bots are different for different systems, which explains the diversity. We seek to provide detailed statistics.

= Why my dummy "spam" comment passed to the WordPress? =
The plugin has several options to detect spam bots and humans. If you just post spammy text like this,

    "I want to sell something", "Buy something here.." and etc

CleanTalk is fully compatible with CloudFlare. Service doesn't filter CloudFlares IP's (AS13335) over blacklists database, so in this way plugin/service filters spam bots uses other anti spam tests.

= Can I use CleanTalk functionality in my plugins? =
Yes, you can. Just use following snippet:

    <?php 
    if(!function_exists('ct_test_message')){
    	include_once( ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/cleantalk-spam-protect/cleantalk.php' );
    }	
    //for registration test:
    $res=ct_test_registration("nickname", "stop_email@example.com", "127.0.0.1");
    //or for some other messages (contact forms, comments etc.)
    $res=ct_test_message("nickname", "stop_email@example.com", "127.0.0.1", "test message");


$res now contents array with two parameters:
  * $res['allow'] - is request allowed (1) or not (0)
  * $res['comment'] - comment for our server's decision.

= I see two loads of script cleantalk_nocache.js. Why are you use it? =
This scrupt is using for AJAX JavaScript checking. Different themes use different mechanisms of loading, so we use two method for loading our script. If you absolutely knows what are you doing, you can switch one of methods off be defining constants in your wp-config.php file:

    define('CLEANTALK_AJAX_USE_BUFFER', false); //false - don't use output buffering to include AJAX script, true - use it

or

	define('CLEANTALK_AJAX_USE_FOOTER_HEADER', false); //false - don't use wp_footer() and wp_header() for including AJAX script, true - use it

= Can I add exclusions for some pages of my site? =
Yes, you can. Add in your wp-config.php file, before defining database constants, this string:

	$cleantalk_url_exclusions = Array('url1', 'url2', 'url3');

Now, all pages containing strings 'url1', 'url2', or 'url3' will be excluded from anti-spam checking. Remember, that this option will be not applied in registrations and comment checking - they are always protected from spam.

= Can I exclude personal data from sending to CleanTalk servers? =
Yes, you can. Add in your wp-config.php file, before defining database constants, this string:

	$cleantalk_key_exclusions = Array('key1', 'key2', 'key3'); 

Now all fields in your submissions with keys named 'key1', 'key2' or 'key3' will be excluded from spam checking.

= How to test Spam FireWall? =
Use special IP 10.10.10.10 in URL to test Spam FireWall. For example,

    https://cleantalk.org/blog/?sfw_test_ip=10.10.10.10

= How can I enter access key in WPMU version? =
To set up global CleanTalk access key for all websites in WPMU, define constant in your wp-config.php file before defining database constants:

    define('CLEANTALK_ACCESS_KEY', 'place your key here');

Now, all subsites will have this access key.

= Why CleanTalk is faster and more reliable than stand-alone solutions? =
All anti-spam checks are held in the cloud and aren't loading the web server. The cloud solutions have a huge advantage since the parameters are compared with information from more 100,000 websites.

= I see in logs a lot of blocked messages with reason  "Forbidden. Please enable JavaScript. Spam sender name." =
A lot of spam bots can't perform JavaScript code, so it is one of the important checks and most of the spam bots will be blocked with reason "Forbidden. Please enable JavaScript. Spam sender name." All browsers can perform JS code, so real visitors won't be blocked.

If you think that message was blocked wrong, let us know about it.

If you or someone from your visitors have error "Forbidden. Enable JavaScript." please check JavaScript support in your browser and do JavaScript test at this page <a href="https://cleantalk.org/checkout-javascript-support">Check out JavaScript support</a>.

= Some thoughts about CAPTCHA =
186	The annoying picture with curved and sloping symbols, which are offered to the visitor to fill in. It is supposed that spam bots won’t discern these symbols, but a visitor will. CAPTCHA provokes great irritation, but if one wants to speak out, he has to fill in these symbols time after time, making mistakes and starting once again. At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource from visitors. Spam bots can automatically recognize Captcha. Spam bots can not pass through the anti-spam CleanTalk, complex invisible checks can immediately detect spam bots.
